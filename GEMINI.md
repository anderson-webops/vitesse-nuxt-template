# Workspace Instructions

- This repository is the Nuxt monorepo template derived from `antfu/vitesse-nuxt`.
- Keep `origin` pointed at the template repository and `upstream` pointed at `antfu/vitesse-nuxt`.
- Maintain the root npm workspace pattern with exactly two primary workspaces: `front-end` and `back-end`.
- Validate template changes with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` before pushing.
- Keep `package-lock.json` up to date whenever dependencies or workspace manifests change.
- Do not leave completed template work uncommitted or unpushed.

## Dependency & Lockfile Discipline

- Treat the repo-root `npm ci` path as the source of truth for deploy readiness.
- Any time `package.json`, any workspace `package.json`, dependency ranges, `package-lock.json`, or dependency update tooling changes, verify lockfile parity from the repo root before committing.
- Do not rely on `npm install` fallback as success. A change is not deploy-ready unless root `npm ci` succeeds.

Required dependency verification before every commit/push:
1. Run `npm ci` from the repository root.
2. Run `npm run lint`.
3. Run `npm run typecheck`.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. If API or back-end behavior changed and the repo has a back-end workspace, run `npm run -w back-end test` or the repo's equivalent API test command.

If `npm ci` fails because `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are out of sync:
1. Run `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-fund --no-audit` from the repository root.
2. Re-run `npm ci` from the repository root.
3. Commit the resulting `package-lock.json` change with the related dependency/package change.

Never commit or push dependency/package changes if root `npm ci` fails.
